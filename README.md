# PoP_student_submissions
This is a repository for students of Year 2 mathematics to submit their answers for other students to admire.


Please add your solutions in the exercise folder following a similar folder naming structure. Please do not edit anyone else's work.

## Instructions for adding your work
1. Clone the repository onto your machine - `git clone https://github.com/ShivamAmratlalPatel/PoP_student_submissions`
2. Create a new folder within the exercise folder with a name as described above, e.g. for exercise 2: go into the exercise-2 folder, then create a folder named "exercise-2-username".
3. Copy over your work into this folder, but **MAKE SURE TO REMOVE THE .git AND .github FOLDERS FROM YOUR FOLDER**. Removing these folders is very important, as without removing them the folder will be added as a submodule, but without a reference url, so your folder will simply appear as an empty folder to anyone cloning the repository. To clarify, only remove the .git and .github folders from _your_ folder, not the top-level folder.
